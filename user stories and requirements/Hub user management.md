## User Story:  
### (2) Enable, disable DFSP profile 

As a hub user, I want to enable DFSP so that I can DFSP users can start using merchant registry portal to handle their merchant data. 

As a hub  user, I want to disable DFSP profile including all users who are handing from DFSP side so that DFSP users cannot use the portal anymore in case DFSP is no longer in the system.

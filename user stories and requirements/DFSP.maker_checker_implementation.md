## Create DFSP users with Maker/Checker roles 

4 **As a** digital financial service provider system admin, **I want to** create a maker-checker system to ensure accuracy and accountability in the system. 

* 1.1. **As a** maker, **I want to** be able to perform actions such as creating new merchant records or changing merchant details **so that** merchant can start using the payment system.  

* 1.2. **As a** checker, **I want to** have the ability to review and approve or reject the actions of the maker so that I can ensure that any mistakes or errors are caught before they cause issues for merchant payment and merchant records comply with scheme rules and procedures **so that** I can prevent fraud activities in the future.   

* 1.3. **As an** admin, **I want** the maker's actions to be placed in a pending state until the checker approves them **so that ** I can ensure there is an extra layer of security and accountability in the system. 

* 1.4. **As a** maker, **I want** to be notified when my action is approved or rejected by the checker **so that** I can stay informed and adjust my actions as needed. 

* Maker,checker mechanism will : merchant data entry (bulk upload, single entry), updating merchant record data attributes

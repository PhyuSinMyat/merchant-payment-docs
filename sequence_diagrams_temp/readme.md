description: an overview of the sequence diagrams
---  

The sequence diagrams are based on v1.1 of the mojaloop API as documented [here](https://docs.mojaloop.io/api/fspiop/v1.1/api-definition.html). As the merchant payment flow includes identifying the DFSP the following sequence diagrams have been used

- [Get Parties](01_get_parties.puml)
- [Customer Initiated Merchant Payment](02_customer-initiated_merchant_payment.puml)

These have been combined in to a single document called [customer_initiated_sequence](customer_initiated_sequence.md)
